										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Linking Aadhar with PAN has become compulsory</strong> because if your Aadhar is not linked to PAN your income tax return would not be processed. Also, whenever you need to perform a banking transaction above <strong>Rs 50,000</strong>, you need to have your PAN and Aadhar linked. It is really easy to link the PAN card with the Aadhaar card and the government has provided multiple ways to do that. There has been an aggressive campaign by the government over the last few months encouraging individuals to attach Aadhar card to PAN card online.  There are two things you need to consider as creditors and tax-assesses. Firstly, <strong>how to connect Aadhar Card online to PAN Card?</strong> Second, what are the advantages of connecting <strong>Aadhar to PAN.</strong>  As we know the PAN card is a <strong>unique tax identification number</strong> issued by the <strong>Department of Income Tax</strong>. This PAN is important not only for filing your IT returns but also for a number of other activities such as buying jewelry, buying houses, taking a loan, opening a bank account, open a Demat account, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Benefits</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>For the government, Linking the Aadhar Card to the PAN card provides an audit trail for the Government. Now Aadhar card is a must for nearly all transactions and the linkage provides the Income Tax department with a complete trail of activity. This will be the key to plugging leakages in revenue.</li>
<li>Due to a lack of audit trail, a lot of black money in the economy gets generated. Since Aadhar &#8216;s spread is substantially greater than the spread of PAN cards, more people who have evaded taxes will be brought under the tax net, and the tax base will be expanded.</li>
<li>From the government&#8217;s point of view, it would be very difficult for individuals to have several PAN cards which were one of the main methods of tax evasion by spreading income through fictitious PAN cards. Therefore another big loophole in the tax system gets plugged.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>The Importance</strong></h2>
<p>For all PAN cardholders, linking PAN with Aadhar is very important, for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>All PAN cards that aren&#8217;t connected to Aadhaar will be disabled.</li>
<li>Linking PAN to Aadhaar will help to tackle multiple PAN cards issued under the same name</li>
<li>Your tax return form would not be processed unless your PAN is linked to Aadhaar.</li>
<li>For future reference, the user will receive a list of taxes levied on him.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) released a statement related to the linking of Aadhaar with PAN: &#8220;If a person who has been allocated a permanent account number is required to intimate his Aadhaar number, that person&#8217;s permanent account number shall become inoperative immediately after that date for furnishing, intimating or referred to in the Act.&#8217; The CBDT also amended the Income Tax Rules through a notification and introduced Rule 114AAA, which outlined the &#8216;manner of making the permanent account number inoperative&#8217;.</p>
<p><b>There are two ways you can connect PAN and Aadhaar cards</b>. Such are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Via the e-filing website for income tax purposes.</li>
<li>Send a text message to 567678 or 56161.</li>
</ol>
